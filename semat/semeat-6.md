# Overview

Our application idea is a mobile application on the Android platform for UConn’s Bus System. An app does currently exist, however the app has major flaws that we seek to correct. The main feature of this app will be a route search, which takes some location on campus and a desired destination as inputs and returns the most efficient route using UConn’s busses. The app may have other features as well depending on progression rates, like walking directions. Overall, the app will run more efficiently and crash less than the current one as well. Because we as students at very in-tune are the end-user, we are at a very advantageous position for selecting a development methodology. We are leaning towards using Agile development due to the closeness of our team, however we will decide definitely in the coming week after learning more about different methods in class. We are almost done with our app, just need to have some finishing touches and we will be able to launch it. 

Currently we have 28659 lines of code written. We currently have 103 git commits for basic documentation, data fetching code, and this progress report.For other metrics, we have a method count of 236 and an average cyclomatic complexity of 1.70. The maximum cyclomatic complexity is 3. Our maximum depth of inheritance is 7 and our median is 3.

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders in this situation are ourselves, since we are the ones getting the grade. We could also call Professor Edgington a stakeholder since he is judging the quality of our project. If the project goes as expected, there is potential for UConn Transportation to be a stakeholder along with the greater UConn community, as they are the ones that would use such an application.


### Represented

Responsibilities agreed Representatives authorized Way of working supported and respected Collaboration approach agreed by group members.

### Involved

Stakeholder representatives carry out their responsibilities. Stakeholder promptly communicate with each other. Stakeholder representative carry out their responsibilities. Stakeholder representative provide feedback and take part in decision in timely way.

### Statisfied in Use

System has met or exceed minimal stakeholder expectations. Stakeholder needs and expectations are being met.

### Action Items

We should identify an approach for collaborating with Professor Edgington with regards to checking the status of our project and ensuring that we are on the right track.

## Opportunity

The deplorability of the current bus app is real.

### Identified

Idea behind opportunity defined At least one investing stakeholder interested (our group) Other stakeholders identified (UConn Transportation, students, etc)

### Solution Needed

Solution identified Problems and root causes identified Need for a solution confirmed At least one solution proposed.


### Value Established

Success criteria clear Value of software system understood The value of a successful solution established.

### Action Items

We should seek to quantify the value of our app and better understand how it will impact the UConn community. I think we are all clear, however, that a successful outcome looks like an A on our transcripts as well as helpful to UConn community.

### Viable

A solution has been outlined and indications are solution can be developed and deployed within constraints. Risks are manageable.

## Software System

We are heading to our finishing point, just need to work on the quality and realiability aspects.

### Architecture Selected

Technologies selected Decisions on system organization made HW platforms identified Platorms, technologies, and language selected.

### Action Items

We really need to work through the first card and the second soon. Architectures need to be agreed on and we need to start building up proof of concept demonstrations of what we will eventually be trying to accomplish.

### Demonstrable 

Key architecture characteristics demonstrated. Relevant stakeholders agree architecture is appropriate. 
Critical interface and system configurations exercised.


## Work

We planned out everything and started working on Mock-up design Currently we are planning, our resources have been focused on groundwork.

### Initiated

Required result clear Initiator identified Priority clear

### Under Control

Work going well. Unplanned work & re-work under control. Work items completed within estimated time. Measures tracked.

### Principles Established

Principles and constraints established Principles and constraints commited to. Practices and tools agreed to Context team operates in understood.

### Action Items

We need to better understand our resources and limitations. We've had some grand ideas, but we haven't fully accounted for how much time we are going to put into this project amidst our other classes, activities, etc. Once we have an effort commitment from everyone, we will be prepared to being building.

## Way of Working

### Foundation Established

Key practices and tools ready. Capability gaps analyzed and understood.
Selected Practices, and tools integrated.

### Principles Established

Tool needs agreed Practice & tool constraints known Capability gaps analyzed and understood. Selected practices and tools integrated.

### In Use

Some members of the team are using the way of working. Use of practices and tools reguraly inspected. Practices and tools being adapted and supported by the team. Procedures in place to handle feedback.

### In Place

All members of the team are using the way of working. All members have access to practices and tools to do their work. Whole team in inspection and adaptataion of way of working.

### Working Well

Way of working is working well for the team but, needed some commitments towards task's deadlines. 
Team members are making progress as planned. Tools also support the way of working. 

### Action Items

For our software developent method, we are using the mixture of agile and waterfall methods because this methods would help us have a strong documentation so, in future we can work on this project to make it stable and fix bugs. We kind of used both methods since there were times that we didn't plan things out beforehand 

## Team

### Seeded

Mission defined Constraints known and defined Responsibilities outlined. 
Team knows how to grow to achieve mission. Required competencies are identified and team size is determined.

### Formed

Enough members recruited Roles understood Members introduced Communication mechanisms defined Members know their responsibilities.

### Callaborating

Members working as one unit. Communaction is open and honest. Memebers focused on team mission.

### Performing

Team working effeciently and effectively Adapt to changing context. Waste is continually eliminated.


## Requirements

### Conceived

Stakeholders agree system is to be produced Users identified Opportunity clear

### Coherent 
The big picture is clear and shared with all the group members.Important usage scenarios explained and Priorities are clear. Impact is understood. All the conflicts are addressed. 

### Bounded

System purpose agreed System success clear Shared solution understanding exists Mechanisms for handling requirements are agreed. Constraints and assumptions identified.

### Action Items

Address conflicts that arise due to data and system configuration constraints.

### Acceptable 
Requirements describe a solution acceptable to the stakeholders.
The rate of cahnge to be agreed, requirements are low but, still have a lot of minor changes to work on. Our value is clear. 

### Fulfilled
The system fully satifies the requirements and the need. Even though the product is not fully ready to launch.
