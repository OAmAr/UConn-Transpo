##Stakeholders
I think that the stakeholders in this situation are ourselves, since we are the ones getting the grade. We could also call Professor Edgington a stakeholder since he is judging the quality of our project. Because this is a school project and not a business project, the stakeholder section is going to be a bit weird but it will still generally function as it was meant to. 

###Recognized
- Stakeholder groups identified
- Key stakeholder groups represented 
- Responsibilities defined

###Represented
- Responsibilities agreed
- Representatives authorized
- Way of working supported and respected

###Action Items
We should identify an approach for collaborating with Professor Edgington with regards to checking the status of our project and ensuring that we are on the right track. 

##Opportunity
The deplorability of the current bus app is real. 

###Identified
- Idea behind opportunity defined
- At least one investing stakeholder interested
- Other stakeholders identified

###Solution Needed
- Solution identified
- Problems and root causes identified
- Need for a solution confirmed
- At least one solution proposed

###Value Established
- Success criteria clear

### Action Items
We should seek to quantify the value of our app and better understand how it will impact the UConn community. I think we are all clear, howver, that a successful outcome looks like an A on our transcripts. 

##Software System
We should get moving on this...

###Architecture Selected
- Technologies selected
- Decisions on system organization made
- HW platforms identified

###Action Items
We really need to work through the first card and the second soon. Architectures need to be agreed on and we need to start building up proof of concept demonstrations of what we will eventually be trying to accomplish.
