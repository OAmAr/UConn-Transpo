Overview

Our application idea is a mobile application on the Android platform for UConn’s Bus System. An app does currently exist, however the app has major flaws that we seek to correct. The main feature of this app will be a route search, which takes some location on campus and a desired destination as inputs and returns the most efficient route using UConn’s busses. The app may have other features as well depending on progression rates, like walking directions. Overall, the app will run more efficiently and crash less than the current one as well. Because we as students at very in-tune are the end-user, we are at a very advantageous position for selecting a development methodology. We are leaning towards using Agile development due to the closeness of our team, however we will decide definitely in the coming week after learning more about different methods in class.

Currently we have ~5,348 lines of code written, most of it fetches data from the transportation database. We currently have 30 github commits for basic documentation, data fetching code, and this progress report.

##Stakeholders

The stakeholders in this situation are ourselves, since we are the ones getting the grade. We could also call Professor Edgington a stakeholder since he is judging the quality of our project. If the project goes as expected, there is potential for UConn Transportation to be a stakeholder along with the greater UConn community, as they are the ones that would use such an application.

*######Recognized*

Stakeholder groups identified

Responsibilities defined


######Represented

Responsibilities agreed
Representatives authorized
Way of working supported and respected
Collaboration approach agreed by group members. 

######Involved 

Stakeholder representatives carry out their responsibilities.
Stakeholder promptly communicate with each other. 
Stakeholder representative carry out their responsibilities.
Stakeholder representative provide feedback and take part in decision in timely way. 

######Statisfied in Use

System has met or exceed minimal stakeholder expectations. 
Stakeholder needs and expectations are being met. 


######Action Items

We should identify an approach for collaborating with Professor Edgington with regards to checking the status of our project and ensuring that we are on the right track.



##Opportunity

The deplorability of the current bus app is real.

######Identified

Idea behind opportunity defined
At least one investing stakeholder interested (our group)
Other stakeholders identified (UConn Transportation, students, etc)

######Solution Needed

Solution identified
Problems and root causes identified
Need for a solution confirmed
At least one solution proposed

######Value Established

Success criteria clear
Value of software system understood
The value of a successful solution established. 


######Action Items

We should seek to quantify the value of our app and better understand how it will impact the UConn community. I think we are all clear, however, that a successful outcome looks like an A on our transcripts as well as helpful to UConn community.

##Software System

We should get moving on this...

######Architecture Selected

Technologies selected
Decisions on system organization made
HW platforms identified

######Action Items

We really need to work through the first card and the second soon. Architectures need to be agreed on and we need to start building up proof of concept demonstrations of what we will eventually be trying to accomplish.

##Work

We planned out everything and started working on Mock-up design Currently we are planning, our resources have been focused on groundwork.

######Initiated

Required result clear
Initiator identified
Priority clear

######Action Items

We need to better understand our resources and limitations. We've had some grand ideas, but we haven't fully accounted for how much time we are going to put into this project amidst our other classes, activities, etc. Once we have an effort commitment from everyone, we will be prepared to being building.

##Way of Working

######Principles Established

Tool needs agreed
Practice & tool constraints known

######Action Items

We need to establish which software development method we will use (agile, waterfall, etc).

##Team

######Seeded

Mission defined
Constraints known and defined
Responsibilities outlined

######Formed

Enough members recruited
Roles understood
Members introduced
Communication mechanisms defined

######Action Items

We need to decide when we can meet routinely to discuss progress outside of class.

##Requirements

######Conceived

Stakeholders agree system is to be produced
Users identified
Opportunity clear

######Bounded

System purpose agreed
System success clear
Shared solution understanding exists
Constraints identified and considered

######Action Items

Address conflicts that arise due to data and system configuration constraints.
